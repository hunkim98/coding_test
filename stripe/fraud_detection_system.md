Fraud Detection System
Task Overview
Design a machine learning system that finds fraudulent transactions on a payment platform.

Main Focus Areas
This problem mixes two types of design: ML System Design and Traditional System Design. You must be ready to discuss the Machine Learning parts. However, you also need to explain the infrastructure (servers and databases) needed to run fraud detection at a large scale.

What to Expect
In the interview, you will likely discuss both ML topics and how the system is built:

Machine Learning Topics
Data Handling: How do you gather, clean, and prepare transaction data?
Model Choice: Which models work best for catching fraud? How do you handle class imbalance (when there are very few fraud cases compared to normal ones)?
Measuring Success: What metrics will you use to check if the model is working well?
Going Live: How do you move the model into production?
Maintenance: What problems might happen after the model is live, and how do you fix them?
Infrastructure and Setup
Besides the ML parts, expect questions about the system setup:

Scalability: How will the system handle growth?
Reliability: How do you make sure the system stays online and does not crash?
Throughput: How do you handle a massive number of transactions at the same time?
Diagrams: Be ready to draw the full system architecture. This includes databases, servers, and how they talk to each other.

Real Interview Insight
A candidate for a Machine Learning Engineer role at Stripe reported this question. The unique part of this problem is that it mixes ML design with standard system design concepts.

For the ML part, you can use standard preparation methods: focus on data processing, model choice, evaluation metrics, and deployment.

However, the interview heavily focuses on system architecture. Candidates had to draw a full diagram showing the components, such as databases and servers. The interviewer asked key questions about Scalability, Reliability, and Throughput.

The interviewer was very helpful. They guided candidates through the architecture part. Even candidates who were not experts in traditional system design felt they could solve the problem with the interviewer's help.
