Metric Counter Library
What We Need to Build
We need to design a library that helps services count and track data (metrics). Most real-world systems use this to track events, check speed, and show graphs on dashboards.

Your library needs a simple interface. Services will use it to save data and check values. The library must do three main things:

Count up: Record when things happen (like API calls, errors, or user clicks).
Check time windows: Look at counts for specific times (like the last minute, hour, or day).
Use tags: Allow us to label data with details (like server region or error code).
Code Structure
// Add to the count
void increment(String metricName)
void increment(String metricName, Map<String, String> tags)
void increment(String metricName, Map<String, String> tags, long value)

// Get the total count for a specific time
long getCount(String metricName, TimeWindow window)
long getCount(String metricName, Map<String, String> tags, TimeWindow window)

// Example usage:
counter.increment("api.requests", Map.of("endpoint", "/payments", "status", "200"))
long lastMinute = counter.getCount("api.requests", TimeWindow.LAST_MINUTE)
Important Design Choices
Performance: How do we record a lot of data very fast? We must not slow down the main service.
Memory: Storing data for different time windows takes space. How do we make sure we don't use too much memory?
Accuracy: Do the numbers need to be perfect? Is it okay to use an estimate? When should we use probabilistic data structures?
Sending Data: How and when do we send the metrics to a central system for storage?
Deeper Questions
Be ready for the interviewer to ask harder questions about the details:

Window Types: How do you code sliding windows versus tumbling windows? What is good or bad about each?
High Cardinality: What happens if a metric has too many unique tags (like one for every User ID)?
Thread Safety: How do you make sure the count is correct when many threads write at the same time?
Sending Batches: How often does the library send data out? What happens if the send fails?
Clock Skew: How do you handle time windows if the system clock is slightly wrong?
Aggregation: Do you sum up the numbers locally first, or send every raw event?
Memory Limits: How do you stop the library from crashing the app if memory gets full?
Integration: How does this work with tools like Prometheus or StatsD?

Final Thoughts
This question tests if you understand the tools engineers use every day. If you have used monitoring libraries like Micrometer or Prometheus, you will have an advantage.

Focus on explaining exactly how you handle time windows. Also, talk about real-world problems like keeping memory usage low and making sure data is sent reliably.
